  <p><em>The following is a transcript of my ignite talk given at the <a href="https://www.devopsdays.ch/">DevOpsDays Zurich 2024</a> earlier this week. Well, at least it is the transcript of what I</em> wanted <em>to say and</em> think <em>I&rsquo;ve said. I am not 100% sure because I was quite nervous. I will check once the organizers have published the video of the talk, and I will then also add the link to the video.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/speaking.jpg" alt="1. picture 1"></p>
<p><em>I had never spoken at any conference before. As a product owner and former scrum master, I am used to facilitating events with my team or presenting to customers. In such informal settings, the speaker usually speaks freely and abuses the slides as notes to remember what they want to say. That&rsquo;s why most such slides contain much too much text. In the extreme case, they contain the full speech and would better just be sent out for everyone to read by themself instead of being read aloud to the gathered audience.</em></p>
<p><em>So the first thing to invest in for a conference talk is the slides: They should only contain the main message points and visual elements to support the message, lighten the mood or entertain the audience. They should not distract the audience from what the speaker is saying. The listener should not have to constantly decide whether they want to read or listen. When I handed in my slides, I thought I had stripped them down to the minimum. Looking at them today, I would greatly reduce the text even further.</em></p>
<p><em>The full PDF slide deck can be found <a href="/files/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk.pdf">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)">ignite</a> format is quite special: The speaker hands in 20 slides which are auto-advanced every 15 seconds, 5 minutes in total. During the talk, the speaker has no control over their slides; they just advance every 15 seconds. That probably makes free speaking a bad idea because the talk might fall behind or run ahead of the slides.</em></p>
<p><em>Good timing must be practiced:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>when some words are hard to pronounce or twist your tongue &ndash;&gt; find alternatives</em></li>
<li><em>when a slide always advances too fast &ndash;&gt; shorten the text or split the slide into two</em></li>
<li><em>when you always have to wait for a slide to advance &ndash;&gt; merge two slides into one</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I would assume that slam poets work similarly. If you love language, rhythm and flow, the preparation process is a lot of fun. I had the privilege of work colleagues who supported me with their feedback. And that&rsquo;s the result:</em></p>
<p>My topic today is &ldquo;wholesome talk - language patterns for feedback and learning&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg01.png" alt="2. slide 1"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special topic for me because I usually tell people that the walk is more important than the talk. But that&rsquo;s when they are just using agile buzzwords instead of applying agile principles and living agile values.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg02.png" alt="3. slide 2"></p>
<p>I recently came to understand that there is another type of talk which enables and supports the walk. The eye-opener was the book <a href="https://davidmarquet.com/leadership-is-language-book/">&ldquo;Leadership is Language&rdquo;</a> by <a href="https://davidmarquet.com/">David Marquet</a> who is better known for his first book <a href="https://davidmarquet.com/turn-the-ship-around-book/">&ldquo;Turn the Ship Around!&quot;</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg03.png" alt="4. slide 3"></p>
<p>I call this type of talk &ldquo;wholesome talk&rdquo;. It consists of language patterns which invite feedback and foster learning.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg04.png" alt="5. slide 4"></p>
<p>But there is one important precondition for this to work: Leaders have to care about feedback and diversity of opinion.</p>
<p>Some leaders don&rsquo;t want any feedback because they are so convinced of their own genius.</p>
<p>They are not curious.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to learn.</p>
<p>They will never walk agile.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg05.png" alt="6. slide 5"></p>
<p>A tragic implementation of this anti-pattern to agility is Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>If you want to read about the devastating effects of Mao&rsquo;s genius on the Chinese economy, check out the last chapter of <a href="https://timharford.com/">Tim Harford</a>&rsquo;s book <a href="https://timharford.com/books/undercovereconomist/">&ldquo;The Undercover Economist&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg06.png" alt="7. slide 6"></p>
<p>Feedack hits you anyway - sooner or later.</p>
<p>In Agile and DevOps, we want to get feedback as soon as possible, while we still have time to react and adapt.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg07.png" alt="8. slide 7"></p>
<p>But leaders must be careful because they can stifle feedback even without intention.</p>
<p>Leaders are convincing.</p>
<p>They are experienced, visionary, charismatic or even all three at once.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they are leaders.</p>
<p>If they present their ideas and opinions first&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg08.png" alt="9. slide 8"></p>
<p>&hellip; the others will listen but no one will speak up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why leaders must listen first and speak last.</p>
<p>They must do everything they can to flatten the Power Gradient.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg09.png" alt="10. slide 9"></p>
<p>Imagine you are a leader or expert or senior team member and approach your colleagues like this, explicitly highlighting all your expertise and experience. Well, who could then say anything <em>against</em> your opinion?!</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg10.png" alt="11. slide 10"></p>
<p>You will get alternative viewpoints only if you actively invite them and communicate with your colleagues on eye level.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg11.png" alt="12. slide 11"></p>
<p>You should also avoid common mistakes like the Seven Sins of Questioning, one of which is binary questions.</p>
<p>The problem with binary questions is that they force a 55% yes into a 100% yes and put the full responsibility onto the receiver of the question.</p>
<p>If then anything goes wrong: &ldquo;Well, <em>you</em> said it was safe!&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg12.png" alt="13. slide 12"></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use binary questions!</p>
<p>Use &ldquo;how?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what?&rdquo; questions instead:</p>
<p>How safe is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your tension with this approach?</p>
<p>What might go wrong?</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg13.png" alt="14. slide 13"></p>
<p>Even worse than binary questions are self-affirming binary questions because they really just force the receiver into affirmation.</p>
<p>You will not learn anything new from the answer.</p>
<p>Ask open questions instead: Explicitly ask for what you are missing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg14.png" alt="15. slide 14"></p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;why?&rdquo; because &ldquo;why?&rdquo; might put the receiver into defensive mode.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want your curiosity to be mistaken for criticism, ask &ldquo;what?&rdquo; questions or open questions instead.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg15.png" alt="16. slide 15"></p>
<p>Finally, studies have shown that if you praise a child for being good at something, they will choose a simpler task next to get praised again for being good.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg16.png" alt="17. slide 16"></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you praise them for their effort, they will choose a more complex task next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s natural: We all crave for praise. We all like to feel competent and we all want to be good at what we are doing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg17.png" alt="18. slide 17"></p>
<p>But while being good is good, getting better is better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we want feedback and learning.</p>
<p>And then one day we will do great leaps - even through fire!</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg18.png" alt="19. slide 18"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s recap:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg19.png" alt="20. slide 19"></p>
<p>And time&rsquo;s up already!</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/wholesome-talk/dodzurich2024_ignite_peterhaefliger_wholesometalk_pg20.png" alt="21. slide 20"></p>
<p>Thank you for listening!</p>
<p>No time for feedback now - sorry for that! But feedback is welcome anytime later!</p>
<p><em>I did mention that I was quite nervous, right? So imagine my relief when it was over and had gone well without any major blunders! The following picture was taken right after I had left the stage and received some extra presents from the organizers:</em></p>
