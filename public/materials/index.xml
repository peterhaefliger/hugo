      <description>The following table lists all 93 pairs which can be formed with the numbers from 1 to 60 whose sum is an element of the set {9, 36, 49, 64, 81}:
 the first column lists the numbers i from 1 to 60 the second column lists all the numbers greater than i with which i can be paired the third column lists all the numbers smaller than i with which i can be paired the fourth column lists all the numbers with which i can be paired, smaller or greater     i higher pairs lower pairs all pairs     1 8, 35, 48  8, 35, 48   2 7, 34, 47  7, 34, 47   3 6, 33, 46  6, 33, 46   4 5, 32, 46, 60  5, 32, 45, 60   5 31, 44, 59 4 4, 31, 44, 59   6 30, 43, 58 3 3, 30, 43, 58   7 29, 42, 57 2 2, 29, 42, 57   8 28, 41, 56 1 1, 28, 41, 56   9 27, 40, 55  27, 40, 55   10 26, 39, 54  26, 39, 54   11 25, 38, 53  25, 38, 53   12 24, 37, 52  24, 37, 52   13 23, 36, 51  23, 36, 51   14 22, 35, 50  22, 35, 50   15 21, 34, 49  21, 34, 49   16 20, 33, 48  20, 33, 48   17 19, 32, 47  19, 32, 47   18 31, 46  31, 46   19 30, 45 17 17, 30, 45   20 29, 44 16 16, 29, 44   21 28, 43, 60 15 15, 28, 43, 60   22 27, 42, 59 14 14, 27, 42, 59   23 26, 41, 58 13 13, 26, 41, 58   24 25, 40, 57 12 12, 25, 40, 57   25 39, 56 24, 11 11, 24, 39, 56   26 38, 55 23, 10 10, 23, 38, 55   27 37, 54 22, 9 9, 22, 37, 54   28 36, 53 21, 8 8, 21, 36, 53   29 35, 52 20, 7 7, 20, 35, 52   30 34, 51 19, 6 6, 19, 34, 51   31 33, 50 18, 5 5, 18, 33, 50   32 49 17, 4 4, 17, 49   33 48 31, 16, 3 3, 16, 31, 48   34 47 30, 15, 2 2, 15, 30, 47   35 46 29, 14, 1 1, 14, 29, 46   36 45 28, 13 13, 28, 45   37 44 27, 12 12, 27, 44   38 43 26, 11 11, 26, 43   39 42 25, 10 10, 25, 42   40 41 24, 9 9, 24, 41   41  40, 23, 8 8, 23, 40   42  39, 22, 7 7, 22, 39   43  38, 21, 6 6, 21, 38   44  37, 20, 5 5, 20, 37   45  36, 19, 4 4, 19, 36   46  35, 18, 3 3, 18, 35   47  34, 17, 2 2, 17, 34   48  33, 16, 1 1, 16, 33   49  32, 15 15, 32   50  31, 14 14, 31   51  30, 13 13, 30   52  29, 12 12, 29   53  28, 11 11, 28   54  27, 10 10, 27   55  26, 9 9, 26   56  25, 8 8, 25   57  24, 7 7, 24   58  23, 6 6, 23   59  22, 5 5, 22   60  21, 4 4, 21    </description>
