      <description>I would like to play around a bit with the go programming language. It is not a bad idea to learn a new programming language every once in a while to get to know different ways of thinking about computational problems. I did that extensively in the first years of my professional career when I was working abroad and had a lot of time during my lonely hotel nights. I do it very little today where I prefer to spend my free time with my family.</description>
