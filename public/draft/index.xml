      <description>In this post I tell the story of a beautiful picture which represents an interesting mathematical problem whose algorithmic solution has some analogy to the agile way of making progress.
The picture My former highschool math teacher Hansruedi Widmer (&amp;ldquo;retired as a teacher, not as a mathematician&amp;rdquo;) daily posts mathematical puzzles, bits of history or just &amp;ldquo;fun facts&amp;rdquo; on twitter. On March 1st, 2022, which was the 60th day of the year, he tweeted the following (translation from German is mine):</description>

I did that extensively in the first years of my professional career when I was working abroad and had a lot of time during my lonely hotel nights. I do it very little today where I prefer to spend my free time with my family.</description>
