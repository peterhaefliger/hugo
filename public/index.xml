      <description>This is the second part of of an article about my first trip to Lithuania earlier this month. The first part can be found here.
Day 5: Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights and Stotis District Walk Friday, September 12th
I love the bakeries in Lithuania! What could be better than starting a day like this:
As the day was rather rainy, I dedided to go to a museum. Vilnius has a broad range of museums for art, history, technology etc.</description>

      <description>I am not usually a travel blogger, but colleagues keep looking at me with surprise and asking me why I took a week of leave from work and a trip to Vilnius just to deliver a five-minutes talk at the local DevOpsDays. While this sounds a bit crazy indeed, there is of course a lot more to Lithuania than just the devops community. This is the first part of an article in which I try to paint the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>This is a transcript of the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Vilnius 2025 last week.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what an ignite talk is, you might want to check out my previous article about my first such talk given at the DevOpsDays Zürich last year where I explain the format and how to best prepare for it.
I had a great two days at this event which was perfectly organized.</description>

      <title>wholesome talk - language patterns for feedback and learning</title>

      <description>This article is about the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Zurich 2024 earlier this week.
I had never spoken at any conference before. As a product owner and former scrum master, I am used to facilitating events with my team or presenting to customers. In such informal settings, the speaker usually speaks freely and abuses the slides as notes to remember what they want to say. That&amp;rsquo;s why most such slides contain much too much text.</description>

      <title>Backtracking algorithms: experiment, inspect and adapt</title>

      <description>In this article I tell the story of a beautiful picture which represents an interesting mathematical problem whose algorithmic solution has some analogy to the agile way of solving problems and making progress.
The picture My former high school math teacher Hansruedi Widmer (&amp;ldquo;retired as a teacher, not as a mathematician&amp;rdquo;) daily posts mathematical puzzles, bits of history or just &amp;ldquo;fun facts&amp;rdquo; on X (formerly known as twitter). Two years ago, on March 1st, 2022, which was the 60th day of the year, he tweeted the following (translation from German is mine):</description>

      <title>Table of pairs whose sum is one of the given square numbers</title>

      <description>The following table lists all 93 pairs which can be formed with the numbers from 1 to 60 whose sum is an element of the set {9, 36, 49, 64, 81}:
 The first column lists the numbers i from 1 to 60. The second column lists all the numbers greater than i with which i can be paired. That&amp;rsquo;s the column used by the first (slow) version of the python program.</description>

      <description>This is the translation of my blog post written in German as an assignment for the CAS DevOps Leadership and Agile Methods which I am currently doing at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The translation is rather free, as self-translations usually are, because the author can allow themself full liberties. But let me first explain the context of the course assignment:
During the course, a colleague brought up the question of how shy team members can be encouraged to speak up in a retro.</description>

      <title>Why names in programs matter</title>

      <description>I would like to play around a bit with the go programming language. It is not a bad idea to learn a new programming language every once in a while to get to know different ways of thinking about computational problems. I did that extensively in the first years of my professional career when I was working abroad and had a lot of time during my lonely hotel nights. I do it very little today where I prefer to spend my free time with my family.</description>

      <title>Software Development as a multidisciplinary endeavor</title>

      <description>Last summer I came across an advertisement for a teaching assignment at a swiss university for a module called &amp;ldquo;Software Engineering Basics&amp;rdquo;. I applied and was even invited to an interview, but eventually they chose another candidate with a track record in education. But even if not successful, the application process proved to be a valuable opportunity for learning and self-reflection. When I applied, I knew of course that I lacked the teaching background, but more importantly, I had to ask myself whether I had the necessary domain expertise.</description>

      <description>This first post is an updated version of an article which I have written in January 2021 for an older blog of mine which I have since discontinued. It was the time when we had to prepare our first distributed/online retrospectives during the Corona lockdown. It describes my experience with Fun Retrospectives, a book, website and very helpful online retro tool.
Introduction For those who do not know the term “retrospective” (or “retro” for short), I cite the following method-independent definition:</description>
