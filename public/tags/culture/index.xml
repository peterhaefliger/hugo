      <description>This article is about the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Zurich 2024 earlier this week.
I had never spoken at any conference before. As a product owner and former scrum master, I am used to facilitating events with my team or presenting to customers. In such informal settings, the speaker usually speaks freely and abuses the slides as notes to remember what they want to say. That&amp;rsquo;s why most such slides contain much too much text.</description>

      <description>Last summer I came across an advertisement for a teaching assignment at a swiss university for a module called &amp;ldquo;Software Engineering Basics&amp;rdquo;. I applied and was even invited to an interview, but eventually they chose another candidate with a track record in education. But even if not successful, the application process proved to be a valuable opportunity for learning and self-reflection. When I applied, I knew of course that I lacked the teaching background, but more importantly, I had to ask myself whether I had the necessary domain expertise.</description>
