      <description>This article is about the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Zurich 2024 earlier this week.
I had never spoken at any conference before. As a product owner and former scrum master, I am used to facilitating events with my team or presenting to customers. In such informal settings, the speaker usually speaks freely and abuses the slides as notes to remember what they want to say. That&amp;rsquo;s why most such slides contain much too much text.</description>
