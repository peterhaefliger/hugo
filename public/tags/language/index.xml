Day 5: Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights and Stotis District Walk Friday, September 12th
I love the bakeries in Lithuania! What could be better than starting a day like this:
As the day was rather rainy, I dedided to go to a museum. Vilnius has a broad range of museums for art, history, technology etc.</description>

      <description>I am not usually a travel blogger, but colleagues keep looking at me with surprise and asking me why I took a week of leave from work and a trip to Vilnius just to deliver a five-minutes talk at the local DevOpsDays. While this sounds a bit crazy indeed, there is of course a lot more to Lithuania than just the devops community. This is the first part of an article in which I try to paint the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>This is a transcript of the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Vilnius 2025 last week.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what an ignite talk is, you might want to check out my previous article about my first such talk given at the DevOpsDays Zürich last year where I explain the format and how to best prepare for it.
I had a great two days at this event which was perfectly organized.</description>

      <description>This article is about the ignite talk which I have given at the DevOpsDays Zurich 2024 earlier this week.
I had never spoken at any conference before. As a product owner and former scrum master, I am used to facilitating events with my team or presenting to customers. In such informal settings, the speaker usually speaks freely and abuses the slides as notes to remember what they want to say. That&amp;rsquo;s why most such slides contain much too much text.</description>
