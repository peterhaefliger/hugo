The following table lists all 93 pairs which can be formed with the numbers from 1 to 60 whose sum is an element of the set {9, 36, 49, 64, 81}:

- The first column lists the numbers i from 1 to 60.
- The second column lists all the numbers greater than i with which i can be paired. That's the column used by the first (slow) version of the python program.
- The third column lists all the numbers smaller than i with which i can be paired. That's the column used by the second (backward) version of the python program.
- The fourth column lists all the numbers with which i can be paired, smaller or greaterÂ¨. That's the column used by the third (fast forward) version of the python program.
