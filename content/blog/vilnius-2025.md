_I am not usually a travel blogger. But then again, my first trip to Lithuania was more than just a vacation._

I must admit that two years ago, I did not even know which of the three baltic states is which. And I didn't know anybody from any of them. This changed in April 2024 when I met Evelina at the DevOpsDays in Zürich. [Evelina Rimkutė](https://evelinarimkute.ch/) is a Lithuanian Test Manager living in Switzerland. Her inspiring ignite talk on the power of one story point can be seen on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/11113419?video=942924969) or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaFLd-RBUYo). A few weeks after the event, she published a beautifully designed and crafted [book](https://evelinarimkute.ch/Get-my-book/) on Lithuanian figures of speech:

Being a language aficionado, this of course caught my interest...

I started reading about Lithuanian and Lithuania. I will write a separate article about the language later. In this first post I want to focus on the country. Reading about Lithuania and its rich history opened my eyes to so many things I had never known or long forgotten or just not been fully aware of. I had always been more oriented towards the west than the east. I had been a high school exchange student in the United States in 1991/92. While back in Switzerland I had two years of Russian language classes in high school and even participated in a three-week exchange with a school in Barnaul in the West Siberian Altai region in 1995, my interest later turned west again: I first went to Portugal to learn Portuguese, and later I married a Brazilian. Vacations were mainly spent in western Europe, Brazil and United States. I now after 30 years, I suddenly looked east again.

Probably my interest in Eastern European history had already been sparked two years earlier with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. From my high-school history classes and countless Hollywood movies, my view of World War II had been somewhat limited to the Nazi atrocities in the west (like France) and east (like Poland) and to the concentration camps and the Holocaust. Only with the new Russian threat, the Soviet terror got more of my attention. I was shocked to read stories of Lithuanians rounded up in the middle of the night, loaded into cattle carts where they would spend weeks and months on their way to Siberia where they would die of hunger, cold, sickness or simply the exhaustion of unbearably hard labour, stories which I had previously only known from Holocaust movies like "Schindler's List" or slave trade accounts like Alex Haley's "Roots". If you are brave enough, read [Rūta Šepetys'](https://rutasepetys.com/) novel [Between Shades of Gray](https://rutasepetys.com/books/between-shades-of-gray/):

Finish with the Putin scripture in Vilnius and a spirit of defiance?
