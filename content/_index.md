# Welcome!

Welcome to my personal blog on agile software development!

## About me

My name is Peter Häfliger (sometimes spelt Haefliger when the dots are not available).

I hold a master’s degree in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://rw.ethz.ch) from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://ethz.ch) and I have been working in the software industry since 2001.

Since 2008, I have been with [Avaloq](https://www.avaloq.com) (since 2020 part of [NEC](https://www.nec.com)), a leading financial technology and service provider, in various roles such as software developer, project manager, team lead, business analyst and scrum master. I currently serve as product owner of our Business Process Automation.

I hold the following [certificates from srum.org](https://www.scrum.org/user/628402):

If you are interested in more details about my continuing education or my professional career, please see my profile on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-h%C3%A4fliger-89b107103/). You will see that I call myself "agile software developer and product owner". I sometimes fear that my developer colleagues might find this presumptuous. After all, I have not been a "developer" since I got promoted team lead in 2010. On the other hand, what's my professional purpose other than developing software, even if I am not actually coding? When people talk of a "film-maker", they usually refer to the director or producer, not to the person actually holding the camera. In the same sense, I will always consider myself a software developer, even if my contribution is not in writing code but in identifying customer requirements, reconciling stakeholder priorities and maximizing value.

## About this blog

I created this blog as a repository of thoughts and ideas written down for later reference and discussion. 

As a former scrum master and current product owner, I have great interest in all things agile but also in software engineering and programming topics.

## About the tools and technologies used 

This site is created with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator. I run it in [replit](https://replit.com) which allows me to edit my files from any machine without local installation. Using HUGO allows me to exclusively focus on content written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and not worry about formatting or styling. I use [github](https://github.com) for back-up and version control and [netlify](https://netlify.com) for building, deploying and hosting the site. I use [Caio Lente's](https://lente.dev/en/) [Bear Cub](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/) theme because I like its elegant simplicity and the author's design philosophy as explained [here](https://clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/) and [here](https://lente.dev/en/posts/stone-websites/).

## About the pilgrim icon and avatar

Some years ago when I needed to choose an avatar for a JIRA profile, I first thought of the usual characters with which we try to identify ourselves as developers, like the ninja or the samurai. But then I remembered the [scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/) and started reflecting on the scrum values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect, and suddenly a very different character came to my mind: the pilgrim.

The pilgrim has a vision and decides to embark on a journey to an important goal. Just think of the [Wise Men from the East in the Gospel of Matthew](https://www.bibleserver.com/KJV/Matthew2%3A1): When they suddenly detect a new star in the sky, they know that an old prophecy has been fulfilled. They immediately want to go see the Messiah. They don’t know how to get there or how long it will take them. They just follow the star.

The pilgrim is completely committed to his goal and focused on his mission and has enormous courage: He leaves his comfort zone without knowing the exact route to the goal nor the challenges ahead. He is agile and open-minded – able and willing to learn on the way. He is humble and respects the people who share or cross his path.

Every software project is a pilgrimage. Most of the time, not only the path to the goal is unknown, but even the goal itself is moving. That's why we constantly need to experiment, inspect and adapt:
